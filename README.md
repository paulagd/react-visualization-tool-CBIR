# react-visualization-tool-CBIR
---
This project is a tool that allows to visualize the results of a image retrieval
engine system. The main function is to compute the ranking of similar images for a
query given and visualize the results.

It has three different modes implemented:

    1. Explorer mode

        The user can explore the dataset through `clickable` images which become new
        queries in order to display its ranking.

    2. Annotation mode

        The user can annotate the images which are similar and the ones which are
        not, so that a complete feedback is given to the system. After some computations
        in the current image retrieval engine system, the new and updated ranking
        can be resent and updated.

    3. Query expansion mode

        The user can use this mode to experiment with different queries and see how
        the accuracy of the system and of each singular image improves or not
        depending on which images are selected to compute the `multi query`.

      > mv #name_of_the_UNCOMPRESSED_downloaded_file 6.11.3

  3. Create link to current node version

      > cd /opt/nodejs
      > ln -s 6.11.3 current

  4. Create link to current node binary

      > ln -s /opt/nodejs/current/bin/node /bin/node

  5. Verify node version

      > node -v
